 * This class represents an interface from which to manage the Timer 1 of an ATmega328P processor on a Arduino Uno. It
 * can be use to manage it as a timer in the strict sense of the word, with functionalities for only starting, stopping
 * and resetting it. Moreover, it can perform an action when the specified period of time has elapsed. It can count
 * up to four seconds, more or less, because of the size of the ATmega328P's registers. Every value greater than
 * that will be subsituted by the maximum value allowed into the counter register (2^16 - 1).
